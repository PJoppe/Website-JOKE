                                    I am Joke Verrelst, born in the vibrant heart of Belgium in 1982. My journey into the world of art and creativity is a story of unexpected passion and discovery.
                                    
                                    My professional life began in the field of pharmacy, where I worked as a pharmacy assistant. However, my true passion always lay in the realm of creativity and interior design. In my spare time, I found immense joy in engaging with various creative endeavors.
                                    
                                    In 2016, my artistic journey took an exciting turn when I ventured into abstract painting. It was during this exploration that I was introduced to the captivating world of resin as an artistic medium. Little did I know that this encounter would become a pivotal moment in my life.
                                    
                                    <br><br>
                                    The year 2020 brought unprecedented challenges with the onset of the global pandemic. During those trying times, I found solace and inspiration in my art. It was then that I began crafting those distinctive, tub-shaped resin blocks that have since become a signature of my work.
                                    
                                    One of my most cherished creations during this period was my first resin portrait, a captivating depiction of the timeless icon, Audrey Hepburn. Initially, I never envisioned selling this piece, as it was crafted with the intention of gracing the walls of our own living room.
                                    
                                    However, fate had other plans in store for me. When I took my artwork to "Kaderke" in Heist for framing, the owners were deeply impressed by what they saw. Their enthusiasm led them to inquire whether they could introduce my work to a gallery owner, who also happened to be one of their esteemed customers.
                                    
                                    What followed was a delightful journey of exploration and growth in the art world, a path that I continue to traverse with unbridled passion and dedication. Each piece I create carries a piece of my heart and a story waiting to be shared.
                                    
                                    <br><br>
                                    Thank you for joining me on this artistic voyage. I invite you to explore my portfolio and immerse yourself in the world of resin artistry that I'm privileged to create and share with you.
                                    
                                    <br><br>
                                    Warm regards,
